# Mind-Wandering-Prediction

This repository aims to predict mind-wardering with EEG signals by applying entropy features on [MMSART](http://mmsart.ee.ntu.edu.tw/NTU_SART/) dataset. The experiment results show that the entropy of EEG is low when people are mind-wandering. Also, to solve the problem of high time complexity of multi-scale entropy, I find the substitution of multi-scale entropy, which is multi-scale dispersion entropy. Multi-scale dispersion entropy have similar trend as multi-scale entropy, but it has lower time complexity.
